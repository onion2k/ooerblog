The old content is gone. Wordpress has been sent packing. There's a posting schedule, a proper deployment system, and a better platform. Welcome to the all-new Ooer.com.

### Why the change?

I've been blogging on Ooer.com, on and off anyway, for a decade. That's about half the time I've been writing software for the web. In all the time I've been building websites I've always thought I ought to be sharing the things I learn, having opinions about the things that are important, and generally trying to build a following and become the sort of developer who goes to conferences, does talks, and is well-known.

But, to put it plainly, that's all bullshit. If that's who you are then that's awesome. Use your celebrity for good. It isn't who I am though, and that's OK.

### What should a developer be?

A proportion of the web development industry would have you believe the best way to further your career and become a better developer is to go to meet-ups, user groups, and conferences, and to network your way up the foodchain until you're giving talks and organising things. To an extent there's a great deal of truth in that. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy - people recruit people who are similar to themselves, so if you're applying to a company that's run by people who think conferences are the way to go then they'll look for people who enjoy a good conference.

I used to be that person. I did a few talks. They bombed, and I hated doing them. I went to events. I quite enjoyed them, but I hated the "networking" side so I stopped going (this was a choice, and no reflection on the events in question). My choices about what to code and what to learn were guided by the opinions of celebrity developers, but I didn't really like what they were flying banners for. In short, I stopped enjoying coding because of the choices I was making.

So I took a step back, and thought about what a developer should be.

My conclusion is simply "Whatever they feel happy being."
